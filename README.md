**A Machine learning project to predict the best crop for the farmer.**

I used Random forest regressor model to predit the best crop for the area based on the inputs like area of production, region, type of crop and so on. I trained the model which suggests the estimated production of a particular crop for a particular region. If the suggested crop below par the average production for given area, I trained the model such that it tells the best crop for that area.

I used ReactJs to build the dynamic web page. I used python flask which serves as a backend and stored the data in sqlite database.
